### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  Starting with our first analysis, we have compiled the original data from the Kickstarter worksheet into a pivot chart filtered by projects in the theater category by success and failure throughout the months of the year. As seen in the pivot chart below, we can see the exact number of successful, failed, canceled plays. As well as the total amount of plays launched each month from the years 2009 to 2017.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
  We can Conclude from the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date that the best season of the year to launch a new Play would be in late spring through the end of summer. Beginning in April, we can see from the data a sharp increase in the success rate from plays released in this time frame. The best month to launch a successful play shows to be in the month of May. On the Contrary, we can see that the worst season to release a play would be at the end of the year From October to December. These months trend with a low success rate while october has the highest fail rate of all months within the data. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  Starting with the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis, there is a definite limitation in the data regarding the success of plays. one of these being that the data required for the presentation does not include showing the days of the month that showed to have success. This limits us to a total aount per month, this limits the ability to see if there are varying parts of the month as well that tend to have an effect on the success of our plays.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
